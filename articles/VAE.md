# Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

In a nutshell, a VAE is an **autoencoder** whose encodings distribution is **regularised** during the training in order to ensure that its latent space has **good properties** allowing us to generate new meaningful data.

**principal components analysis** (PCA) -- encoder and decoder are linear transforms.
