## Region Proposal Network (RPN)
* Which window on the image should a CNN classifier look at?

**RPN** scores the "objectness" of windows and finds the ones with objects.
- A 3D map encodes a large collection of bounding boxes
- First 2D represent the box center coordinates
- Last dimension represents the box type: **anchor boxes** (small, medium, large) Ã— (wide, square, tall)

## non-maximum suppresion
There are many similar boxes and we don't want to report all of them.
1. Build a sorted list of all windows with "objectness" score above a threshold.
2. While there are windows in the list, choose the window with the highest score and discard from the list all other largely overlapping windows.

## ROI pooling
ROI's are of different shape and size. CNN prefers images of fixed size. **ROI pooling** extracts equal-length feature vectors from all ROI proposals.\

## bounding box regression
To report the precise location of objects, it is needed to refine the bbox if an object is found.
