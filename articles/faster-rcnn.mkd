## Region Proposal Network (RPN)
* Which window on the image should a CNN classifier look at?\

**RPN** scores the "objectness" of windows and finds the ones with objects.

## ROI pooling
ROI's are of different shape and size. CNN prefers images of fixed size. **ROI pooling** extracts equal-length feature vectors from all ROI proposals.\
