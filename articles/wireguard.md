# WireGuard Setup

This note walks through the steps to set up a WireGuard server on a home computer in a home network so that a client device away from home can access the home network and also be able to direct the internet traffic through the WireGuard server.

## Home Network Environment
Here we suppose the home network consists of a home router and several devices connected to it. Let us assume the following:
- The public IP of the router is 101.92.31.37
- The devices on the LAN of the router are assigned local IP's with DHCP
- The LAN IP range is 192.168.0.0/24
- The WireGuard server is assigned a static LAN IP of 192.168.0.254 by the home router
